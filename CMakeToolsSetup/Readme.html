            The latest version of CMake Tools for Visual Studio can be obtained from the

        </p>
        <h2>Obtaining CMake</h2>
        <p>
            CMake is published by Kitware and is not included with CMake Tools for Visual
            Studio.  You will need CMake installed on your computer in order to take
            advantage of certain features, such as context-sensitive help or launching
            the CMake GUI from the Tools menu in Visual Studio.  You can download CMake
            from Kitware's web site at
            <a href="http://www.cmake.org">http://www.cmake.org</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>
            CMake Tools for Visual Studio has a number of user-configurable options that
            you may wish to set in order to have the optimal development experience.  You
            can access these options by selecting Options from the Tools menu in Visual
            Studio and then selecting CMake Tools in the list box on the left-hand side.
            Most notably, the IntelliSense list boxes will show the names of CMake
            commands in all uppercase by default.  If your preferred coding style is to
            use CMake commands in lowercase, you may configure CMake Tools for Visual
            Studio to use lowercase instead.
        </p>
